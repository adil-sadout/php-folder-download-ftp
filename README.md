# php-folder-download-ftp
This webapp works by downloading files/directories from another server via FTP
the goal was to import the app to your hosting plan, and the use it as a migration tool to transfer your website via ftp.
one of the issues that comes with using this tool is timeout error when downloading large files (would be better to use wget in this case).
